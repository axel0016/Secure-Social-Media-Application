# Secure Social Media Application

## Description 
This project is a social media application designed with a strong emphasis on security. Implementing various security concepts, it aims to provide a safe and reliable platform for users to connect and share content. Key security features include:

- **Honeypots**: Utilized to detect and analyze potential attacks, providing insights into malicious activities and enhancing overall security.
  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adding an extra layer of protection for user accounts by requiring a second form of verification during the login process.
  
- **Brute-force Protection**: Implemented measures to prevent unauthorized access attempts, ensuring that user accounts are safeguarded against brute-force attacks.
  
- **Password Validation**: Enforces strong password policies to enhance user account security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of integrating security practices into web applications, making it an ideal reference for developers interested in building secure systems.
